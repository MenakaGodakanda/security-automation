### Explanation

#### Log Monitoring:
Monitors log files and alerts on errors.
- monitor.py script monitors log files in the `logs/` directory.
- It reads log entries from `sample.log` and alerts if any error or suspicious activity is detected.

#### Security Policy Enforcement:
Reads and applies security policies.
- enforce.py script reads security policies from the `policies/` directory.
- It applies the policies found in `sample_policy.txt`.

#### Incident Response:
Processes incident reports and executes responses.
- respond.py script processes incident reports found in the `incidents/` directory.
- It responds to incidents described in `sample_incident.txt`.
